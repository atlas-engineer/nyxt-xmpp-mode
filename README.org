#+TITLE:XMPP support prototype for Nyxt

This repository is an archive for the XMPP client prototype mode for Nyxt. The code in here is unlikely to be maintained and updated due to ~cl-xmpp~ (even with [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/cl-xmpp][Atlas fork]]) being overly hard to maintain and extend for the purposes of XMPP client.

Dependencies of this code are:
- ~nyxt~ (tested mainly on 2.2.4 and several 3-pre-releases, you might need tweaking the code depending on which Nyxt version you run).
- ~cl-xmpp~ (with all the extensions: SASL, TLS).
